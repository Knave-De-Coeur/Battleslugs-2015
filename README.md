# Battleslugs-2015

---

## Description

My University Project for 2015, Simple PvP game:

Player 1 generates random slugs shown on the mini map on the botom right
Player 1 places slug on their board
Player 1 does this 5 times, with a total of 25 lives

Player 2 generates random slugs shown on the mini map on the botom right
Player 2 places slug on their board
Player 2 does this 5 times, with a total of 25 lives

Game starts rules:
Player 1 clicks button on the board, hit or miss on player 2, plater stats updated.
Player 2 clicks button on the board, hit or miss on player 1, player stats updated.

At any point in the game both players can switch the maps around to get a better view of the stats of their slugs

Game ends until a player strikes all locations on the board where a slug was placed by the opposing player.

## Instructions
To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:
